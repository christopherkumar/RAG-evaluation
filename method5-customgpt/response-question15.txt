Main Components of Soil Biology
According to current research, the main components of soil biology can be broadly classified into living and non-living organic matter:

Living Components
Microflora:

Bacteria: Play a crucial role in nutrient cycling, decomposing organic matter, and promoting plant growth.
Fungi: Important for decomposing complex organic substances and forming symbiotic relationships with plants (e.g., mycorrhizae).
Microfauna:

Protozoa: Feed on bacteria and help control bacterial populations, also contributing to nutrient cycling.
Nematodes: Include both beneficial and harmful species, playing roles in decomposition and plant health.
Mesofauna:

Mites and Collembola: Help decompose organic matter and enhance soil structure by breaking down plant material.
Macrofauna:

Earthworms: Significantly improve soil structure, nutrient availability, and organic matter decomposition.
Ants and Termites: Contribute to organic matter breakdown and soil aeration.
Dung beetles: Play a role in recycling nutrients from animal waste into the soil​​.
Non-Living Organic Matter
Plant Residues: Includes crop stubble and decaying plant roots that add organic matter to the soil.
Animal Residues: Dead and decaying remains of soil fauna.
Decomposed Organic Matter: Broken down into various forms like particulate, humic, and resistant fractions, each playing a role in the soil's nutrient cycle and structure​​.
Additional Key Aspects
Soil Organic Matter (SOM): Composed mainly of carbon and includes living microorganisms and decomposing organic material.
Nutrient Cycling: The process by which organic and inorganic matter is recycled through the soil system, heavily influenced by soil biota.
Rhizosphere: The zone of soil surrounding plant roots with high microbial activity due to root exudates.
Mycorrhizae: Symbiotic fungi that extend the root system and enhance nutrient uptake, especially phosphorus and zinc​​.
Understanding these components helps in managing soil health for sustainable agricultural production, ensuring that both living and non-living organic matter are maintained and enhanced through appropriate agricultural practices.
