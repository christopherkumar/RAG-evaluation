The best practices to manage soil compaction in wet conditions include:

Time and Patience: Allowing soils to recover naturally with time is important, especially for smectitic clays which can shrink and swell, alleviating compaction over time.

Cultivation: If the soil has dried out enough, surface cultivation can help alleviate some of the surface compaction. However, this is only effective to a certain depth.

Digging and Assessment: Digging pits to assess the depth and severity of compaction can help in determining the level of remediation needed.

Crop Selection: Planting crops that can help in drying the soil profile and creating natural cracks can also be beneficial.

Avoid Overworking Wet Soils: Managing traffic on wet soils and avoiding excessive tillage can prevent further compaction​​.
