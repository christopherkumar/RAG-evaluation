Assessment Methods for Porosity, Mottling, and Soil Color in Visual Soil Assessments
Porosity
Porosity assessment involves examining the soil structure and the size and shape of the soil aggregates. A slice of soil is lifted to observe its crumbly nature, indicating good porosity if it has fine aggregates that allow for water infiltration and gas exchange. The presence of roots throughout the aggregates also indicates good porosity. The assessment includes a scoring system where the soil is rated on a scale, for instance, a score of 1.5 out of 2 might be given for soil with satisfactory porosity but with some limitations due to clay content​​​​.

Mottling
Mottling is assessed by examining the soil for color changes associated with anaerobic conditions. The presence of mottles indicates periods when the soil has been waterlogged, reducing various soil elements and causing distinct color changes. The percentage of the soil face that shows mottling is estimated, and lower percentages (e.g., around 5% or less) suggest that the soil is rarely anaerobic and is in good condition. This aspect of the assessment also uses a scoring system, for instance, giving a score of 2 for soils with minimal mottling​​​​.

Soil Color
Soil color is compared to a reference, such as fence line soil or tree line soil, to infer the organic matter content. The comparison helps in estimating soil carbon levels, which are typically low in Australian soils. The subtle color differences, which may represent a fraction of a percent change in soil carbon, are used to assess the soil condition. A good score is given to soils that show favorable color indicative of higher organic matter content​​​​.

These methods are part of a broader Visual Soil Assessment (VSA) framework that provides a systematic way to evaluate soil health and fertility by visually examining and scoring various soil attributes​​​​.
