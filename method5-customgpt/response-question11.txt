Principles of the Resistance Management Plan (RMP)
Minimizing Exposure:

Reduce the exposure of Helicoverpa species to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins (Cry1Ac, Cry2Ab, and Vip3A).
Maintaining Susceptible Populations:

Provide a population of susceptible individuals to mate with resistant ones, diluting potential resistance genes.
Removing Resistant Individuals:

Ensure that resistant individuals are eliminated at the end of the cotton season​​.
Elements of the Resistance Management Plan (RMP)
Planting Timing Restrictions:

Control the timing of planting to limit the number of Helicoverpa generations exposed to Bt cotton within a season.
Refuge Crops:

Plant non-Bt refuge crops to maintain a population of susceptible Helicoverpa that can dilute any resistance developing in the Bt cotton fields.
Control of Volunteers and Ratoon Cotton:

Manage volunteer and ratoon (regrowth) cotton plants to prevent them from hosting resistant Helicoverpa larvae.
Pupae Destruction/Trap Crops:

Implement strategies such as soil disturbance and trap crops to destroy overwintering pupae of Helicoverpa spp.
Spray Limitations:

Restrict the use of insecticides in and around Bt cotton fields to reduce selection pressure for resistance​​.
