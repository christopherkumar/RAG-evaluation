Cracking clays (Vertosols): These soils are naturally fertile, alkaline, with high clay content (>35%), and high organic matter content. They were formed from fertile alluvium and wind-blown dust under conditions of relatively low rainfall.
Chromosols: Found in regions such as the Macquarie, Namoi, Gwydir, Lachlan, and Murrumbidgee valleys.
Sodosols: Present in many Queensland districts. These soils supported natural vegetation of woodland and grassland and were generally used for grazing and dryland cereal cropping before cotton cultivation​​.
