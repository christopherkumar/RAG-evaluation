Poor physical soil structure: Issues such as compaction can limit root growth, reducing nutrient uptake even if sufficient nutrients are available.
Soil chemical toxicities: Factors like salinity, sodicity, and inappropriate pH levels can hinder nutrient absorption.
Nutrient deficiency: A lack of one nutrient can limit crop growth and the plant's ability to take up or metabolize other nutrients.
Crop maturation: As the crop matures, nutrients and sugars are diverted from vegetative parts to reproductive organs.
Oxygen supply: Limited oxygen supply, often due to waterlogging, can restrict root metabolic processes, including nutrient uptake​​.
