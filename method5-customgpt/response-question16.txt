Influence of Soil Biology on Nutrient Cycles in Crop Systems
Soil biology significantly influences nutrient cycles in crop systems through various processes involving soil microorganisms and fauna. Here are the key ways soil biology impacts nutrient cycles:

1. Mineralisation and Immobilisation
Mineralisation: Soil microorganisms decompose organic matter, converting it into inorganic forms that plants can uptake. For instance, organic nitrogen (N) is converted to ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-), which are plant-available forms​​.
Immobilisation: Microorganisms can also convert inorganic nutrients back into organic forms as they assimilate them for growth, temporarily making them unavailable to plants​​.
2. Nutrient Cycling
Nitrogen Cycle: Soil bacteria play a crucial role in nitrogen transformations, including nitrification (conversion of ammonium to nitrate) and denitrification (conversion of nitrate to gaseous nitrogen, N2). These processes regulate the availability of nitrogen to crops and influence nitrogen loss through leaching and volatilisation​​.
Phosphorus Cycle: Mycorrhizal fungi enhance phosphorus uptake by extending the root's access to soil phosphorus through their hyphal networks. This is especially important in soils with low phosphorus availability​​.
3. Soil Organic Matter (SOM)
SOM is critical for nutrient cycling as it acts as a reservoir for nutrients and releases them slowly through microbial decomposition. The decomposition process is affected by soil moisture, temperature, and the carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio​​.
Decomposed organic matter improves soil structure, water retention, and cation exchange capacity (CEC), which in turn enhances nutrient availability to plants​​.
4. Rhizosphere Interactions
The rhizosphere, the soil zone surrounding plant roots, is rich in microbial activity due to root exudates that provide nutrients for microorganisms. These microorganisms, in turn, facilitate nutrient uptake by breaking down organic matter and mobilising nutrients​​.
5. Role of Soil Fauna
Soil fauna such as earthworms and insects contribute to nutrient cycling by breaking down organic matter and enhancing soil aeration and structure. This activity helps in the mixing of soil layers and the distribution of nutrients within the soil profile​​.
By understanding and managing these biological processes, farmers can optimize nutrient availability in crop systems, leading to improved plant health and productivity. Soil biology thus plays a pivotal role in maintaining the nutrient cycles essential for sustainable agriculture.
