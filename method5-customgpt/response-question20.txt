Common Soil Constraints Affecting Cotton Crops in Australia
Waterlogging

Cotton is poorly adapted to waterlogged conditions. Most cotton in Australia is grown using furrow irrigation on heavy clay soils, which drain slowly and can lead to waterlogging. Symptoms include yellowing, stunted growth, reduced fruit growth, and fruit shedding. Waterlogging can severely restrict crop growth due to oxygen deficiency in the root zone and the accumulation of toxic gases​​.
High Soil Magnesium

High magnesium (Mg) content in soils can be problematic, especially if the Ca:Mg ratio is less than 2:1 or if Mg cations exceed 30%. High Mg can decrease structural stability and increase clay dispersion, particularly when soils are cultivated above their plastic limit. This can lead to poor soil structure and reduced nutrient uptake​​.
Poor Mycorrhizal Colonisation

Long-fallow disorder is associated with poor colonisation of Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhizae (VAM). Long periods of bare fallows or non-mycorrhizal crops reduce VAM populations, affecting nutrient uptake, particularly phosphorus and zinc. Maintaining active VAM populations through crop rotation and shorter fallows is crucial​​.
Soil pH and Chemical Toxicities

Soil pH, salinity, and sodicity can limit root growth and nutrient uptake. High soil pH (alkaline conditions) can reduce phosphorus availability despite high total P content. Soil salinity and sodicity can also impair soil structure and reduce plant growth​​.
Zinc Deficiency

Zinc is the micronutrient most likely to be deficient in Australian cotton soils. Yield losses and reduced crop productivity can result from zinc deficiency, which is influenced by high soil phosphorus, low soil organic matter, and poor mycorrhizal colonisation​​.
Phosphorus Deficiency

Phosphorus deficiency in cotton is common in alkaline soils with high clay content. Deficiency symptoms include stunted plants with dark green or reddish-purple foliage. Correcting phosphorus deficiency typically involves soil and plant tissue testing, followed by appropriate fertiliser application​​.
Sulphur Deficiency

Sulphur deficiency, although rare, can occur in lighter sandy soils or following prolonged waterlogging. Symptoms include pale green plants with yellowing in young leaves and stunted growth. Sulphur is essential for protein synthesis and chlorophyll production​​.
Understanding these constraints and implementing management practices such as proper irrigation, soil amendments, and crop rotation can help mitigate their impact and improve cotton crop productivity.
