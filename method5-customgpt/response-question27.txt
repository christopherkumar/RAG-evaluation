The 2018 edition of NUTRIpak includes several updates and new sections that reflect advances in cotton nutrition and changes in farming practices since the earlier versions. Here are the key differences:

Updated Nutritional Requirements
Higher Yields: The 2018 edition takes into account the higher average yields now being achieved by Australian cotton growers, with farm averages of 15 bales per hectare and field averages over 16 bales per hectare.
Nutrient Management: Corresponding increases in plant nutritional requirements and nutrient exports are addressed, providing more detailed guidance on meeting these higher demands.
Nitrogen Management
Soil Organic Matter: A new section on soil organic matter highlights its importance in the nitrogen cycle and its impact on nitrogen-use efficiency.
Denitrification Risk: Specific information on managing the risk of denitrification in irrigated cotton has been included, reflecting a better understanding of the interactions between nitrogen management and irrigation management.
Phosphorus Management
Banded Applications: The advice on banded applications of phosphorus has been revised. New research suggests that cotton roots are not very effective at exploiting banded applications of phosphorus.
Soil Treatment: The updated recommendation is to treat the largest volume of soil possible to maximize the fertiliser that can be intercepted by plant roots.
Comprehensive Nutrient Guidance
Detailed Nutrient Roles: The manual now includes more detailed explanations of the role of each nutrient in cotton nutrition, how to identify deficiencies, and how to manage nutrient applications effectively.
Additional Nutrients: Expanded sections on other essential nutrients such as potassium, zinc, iron, copper, boron, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, manganese, molybdenum, and chlorine.
Soil and Plant Testing
Soil Testing: Updated procedures for soil sampling and analysis to ensure accurate assessment of soil nutrient status.
Plant Testing: Enhanced guidance on leaf and petiole analyses to diagnose nutritional deficiencies in the cotton crop accurately.
Waterlogging Management
Impacts of Waterlogging: A new section discusses the causes of waterlogging, its impact on crop yield and quality, and soil nutrient availability.
Management Options: Strategies to minimize waterlogging damage, focusing on maintaining soil nutrient availability and improving drainage.
Stubble Management
Stubble Retention: The edition includes updated advice on managing cotton stubble, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of retaining stubble and the impacts on soil health and subsequent crops.
Research Findings: Summarizes recent research on stubble management and provides practical recommendations based on these findings.
Soil Organic Matter
Importance of SOM: A dedicated section discusses the functions of soil organic matter, its current status, and options for reversing its decline.
Organic Amendments: Guidance on using organic matter and organic amendments in cotton systems, considering their long-term benefits for soil health and fertility.
Nutrient Decision Support
NutriLOGIC: Introduces NutriLOGIC, a nutrient decision support system that helps in making informed decisions based on soil, petiole, and leaf analyses.
Practical and Research-Based Approach
Integrated Research: The manual integrates the latest research findings supported by the Cotton Research and Development Corporation (CRDC) and CottonInfo.
Practical Advice: It provides practical, research-based recommendations tailored to the needs of Australian cotton growers.
Overall, the 2018 edition of NUTRIpak is designed to be a comprehensive and up-to-date resource for managing cotton nutrition, reflecting the latest scientific understanding and practical advancements in the field​​.
