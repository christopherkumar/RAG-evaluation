What we’re going to do now is undertake a visual soil assessment. We’re going to take the soil off the bed in this case because it’s probably most indicative of where we’re actually cultivating our crops, but I’ll still make use of the furrow – that’s where I’ll lay out the beat sheet to help sort out the soil when it comes to think about structure. All the instructions around this are in the FAO’s VSA guide, and we’re using the one for annual crops. The first thing is to think about is the texture of the soil – I’ll just loosen some soil at the top here. The soil’s nice and moist, which is something we want when doing a VSA. I’m just getting a small amount (that’s probably too much) of soil, adding a little bit of water… I’m just working that bolus – there’s still some lumps: if there’s any big bits of stone in there pick them out. There’s stuff in the VSA guide about why soil texture’s important, so having a read will remind you of why we do these things. We’ve got a bit of a ball, rolling very nicely, so we already know there’s quite a bit of clay in here; I can’t feel any sand between my fingers so there’s not much sand in this soil. The next thing we do with our bolus is we roll a little sausage and we see if we can extrude it between finger and thumb, just pushing out that centimetre-wide ribbon that’s a few mm thick, and already I can see that’s way over 4-5 cm long so I know this is a clay soil, without a doubt. There’s probably a bit of silt in there (the days are gone where we rub it on our teeth to feel the silt). When I look up my sheet here, we’ve got a clay loam, and that scores a moderate to good (so 1.5 out of 2). This test scores between o and 2, and half scores are allowed. And I’m just going to score that under my soil texture visual score 1.5.
