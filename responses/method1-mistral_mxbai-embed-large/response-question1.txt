 The following cotton weeds have reported glyphosate resistance: windmill grass, awnless barnyard grass, fleabane, sowthistle, feathertop Rhodes grass, and Liverseed grass. 

2. What tactics does the Herbicide Resistance Management Strategy recommend for managing glyphosate-resistant weeds in cotton?
 The Herbicide Resistance Management Strategy recommends using at least two non-glyphosate tactics in summer fallows and two non-glyphosate tactics in the cotton crop. It also suggests using residual herbicides, double knock tactics, strategic cultivations, and manual chipping for controlling larger weeds that may be tolerant to herbicides. 

3. What are the risks of relying on one mode of herbicide action?
 The context states that there is a concern that glyphosate resistance may result in reliance on other herbicidal groups, leading to multiple resistance. For example, reliance on the repeated use of Group 1 grass selective herbicides can quickly lead to development of Group 1 resistance. Similarly, relying solely on glyphosate for weed control in cotton farming systems poses a significant risk for glyphosate resistance to develop. This is because weeds are only exposed to one mode of herbicide action and have the opportunity to evolve resistance over time.
