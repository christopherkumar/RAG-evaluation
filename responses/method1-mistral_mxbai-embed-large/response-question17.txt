 The provided context mainly discusses the benefits of crop rotation and stubble management for cotton farms, as well as the challenges in managing cotton stubble to prevent pest carryover in minimum tillage systems. There is no direct answer to the question about the effects of reconfiguring field layouts on crop productivity within this context. However, we can infer that crop rotation, including the use of break and double break crops, fallows, and pastures, can increase diversity, reduce weed seed banks, optimize nutrient cycling, enhance water conservation, and promote soil health. Crop residue return also plays a role in these benefits, with surface retention reducing evaporation and increasing soil water storage. The context mentions the advantages and disadvantages of retaining cotton stubble, which apply to rotation crop stubble management as well. Overall, the context suggests that implementing good farm hygiene, complementary crop rotations, conserving beneficial populations, regularly monitoring pests, beneficials, crops, and weather, and following effective management practices can lead to increased crop productivity in cotton farming systems.
