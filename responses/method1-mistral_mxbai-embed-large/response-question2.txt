 Retaining cotton stubble has several advantages for soil health and productivity in a cotton farming system. These advantages include:

1. Adding organic matter to the soil: Stubble adds organic matter to the soil, which improves its structure and enhances fertility.
2. Improving soil tilth: The incorporation of stubble into the soil helps improve its tilth, making it more porous and easier for water and air to penetrate.
3. Decreasing soil bulk density: Stubble retention can help reduce soil bulk density, allowing for better root penetration and improved moisture infiltration.
4. Creating greater biological activity in the soil: The decomposition of stubble provides energy to soil microbial biomass, leading to increased biological activity in the soil.
5. Maintaining active populations of soil organisms: Stubble retention helps maintain populations of beneficial soil organisms that contribute to nutrient cycling and disease suppression.
6. Supplying energy to the soil microbial biomass: The decomposition of stubble provides a source of energy for soil microbes, which in turn help break down other organic matter and make nutrients available to crops.
7. Enhancing nutrient cycling: Stubble retention helps enhance nutrient cycling by keeping nutrients in the soil system and making them available to crops over an extended period of time.
8. Improving fertiliser use efficiency: The incorporation of stubble into the soil can help improve fertiliser use efficiency by increasing the availability of nutrients and reducing the need for additional synthetic fertilisers.
9. Improving moisture infiltration: Stubble retention helps improve moisture infiltration, which is particularly important in dry or sandy soils.
10. Reducing wind and water erosion: The presence of stubble on the soil surface helps reduce both wind and water erosion, which can help maintain soil productivity over the long term.

However, retaining cotton stubble also has some disadvantages, including the potential to encourage volunteer cotton plants and the possibility of blocking cultivation equipment or irrigation channels if the stubble is not incorporated. It may also reduce herbicide/soil contact where the stubble remains on the surface, which can impact weed control. Nevertheless, recent research suggests that a cotton-wheat-vetch rotation, with either vetch-residue incorporation or surface retention, can lead to a positive balance of soil organic carbon and improved farm productivity.
