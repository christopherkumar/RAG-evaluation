 The visual soil assessment method determines the health of soil by examining its physical and biological properties, such as its structure, color, texture, and the presence or absence of certain organisms like nematodes. This information provides insight into the soil's ability to support plant growth and sustain productivity, which is a key aspect of soil health. The method may also involve monitoring for patches of unthrifty or stunted plants and collecting soil samples for further analysis, such as nematode populations and nutrient content, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the soil's health status.
