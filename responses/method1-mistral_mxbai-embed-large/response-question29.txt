 The effective management of nutrient cycling in cotton production involves two main strategies: (1) replacement fertiliser program and (2) management strategy. (1) A replacement fertiliser program involves replacing the nutrients that are removed from the soil by the high-yielding cotton crops to maintain the present soil nutritional status. (2) With a management strategy, growers wait until a nutrient becomes limiting before implementing a fertiliser program to meet the crop's demands.

It is important to optimize N management for the desired yield target as the removal of nutrients without replacement can lead to deficiencies and crop production limitations. Nitrogen can be added to the system as nitrogen fertilizer or by growing legume rotation crops, and it can be removed by various processes such as nitrate leaching, denitrification, volatilization, crop residue burning, and nitrogen in harvested seed cotton.

To optimize N management, it is recommended to apply the correct rate of N fertilizer at a time when N loss will be minimal, i.e., after June when cooler conditions slow down the nitrification and denitrification processes. Irrigated crops frequently use less than half the fertiliser if N management is optimized effectively. Additionally, the application of growth regulators such as mepiquat chloride may help reduce problems associated with rank growth in over-fertilised cotton.
