 The cotton growing regions in Australia include soils dominated by cracking clays, specifically vertosols, and other types such as chromosols. These soils are naturally fertile, alkaline, have high clay content (>35%), and were formed from alluvium and wind-blown dust under relatively low rainfall conditions. Additionally, sodosols are present in many Queensland districts. Before cotton cropping, the previous land use was typically grazing and dryland cereal cropping.
