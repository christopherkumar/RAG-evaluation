 Soil biology plays a significant role in nutrient cycles within farming ecosystems by regulating various nutrient cycles such as nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon cycles. The diversity and activity of soil biota, including microbes and invertebrates, are crucial regulators of decomposition and nutrient availability in the soil. Modern agricultural practices, such as reduced biomass inputs, farming methods like cultivation, and fluctuations in soil temperature and moisture, can impact soil biota diversity and activity. This reduction in diversity may have profound effects on the biological regulation of decomposition and nutrient availability, particularly for immobile elements like phosphorus.

Crops, including cotton, can associate with mycorrhizal fungi to increase their uptake of immobile nutrients like phosphorus. These fungi extend their hyphae into the soil and accumulate nutrients, making them available to the plant. Mycorrhizal associations are particularly important for cotton plants in low soil temperatures or following long fallow periods when mycorrhizal colonization is reduced.

Phosphorus, as an immobile element in the soil, benefits from increased soil-root contact to enhance its uptake by crops. Therefore, understanding crop removal amounts of phosphorus and replacing at least that amount is essential for maintaining optimal nutrient availability in the soil.
