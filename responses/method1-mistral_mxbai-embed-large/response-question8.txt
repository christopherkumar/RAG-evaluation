 In a cotton field, you should aim for a comprehensive soil sampling strategy based on the purpose of the sampling, variability in crop performance, and the ability to apply fertilizer products and rates. You should collect samples from high-yielding, average-yielding, and low-yielding zones, using a grid or management zones determined by yield maps. The recommended sampling depth for irrigated cotton is 0 to 30 cm, but you may also need to sample deeper for N following long fallow or after rotational pulse crops, or where subsoil constraints such as salinity and sodicity are likely. You can submit the soil samples for analysis at a laboratory that is certified by ASPAC (Australasian Soil and Plant Analysis Council) and has a credible Quality Assurance program like NATA (National Association of Testing Authorities), Australia or equivalent.
