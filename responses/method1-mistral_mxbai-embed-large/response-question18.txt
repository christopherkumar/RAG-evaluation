 Soil texture is an important factor in visual soil assessments as it impacts the potential for nutrient losses through denitrification and leaching during the crop-growing season. Lighter clays have lower losses compared to heavy clays, while poorly structured or poorly drained soils experience greater losses. This information can help guide the selection of appropriate fertilizer rates and management practices to maintain soil health and productivity.
