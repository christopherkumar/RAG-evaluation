 The soil properties of clay, specifically the cracking clays (vertosols) and other soils like chromosols and sodosols used for cotton production in Australia, have both positive and negative impacts on cotton cultivation. On one hand, these soils are naturally fertile due to their high clay content and initial organic matter. However, over time, these soils have become depleted in nitrogen (N) and organic matter, which can negatively impact cotton production.

Cotton plants require adequate nitrogen to achieve maximum yield, with each crop potentially requiring up to 300 kg N/ha. This is due to the direct effects of nitrogen on crop development and the fact that these soils are less effective at mineralizing native organic matter sources. If too much nitrogen is supplied, it can encourage rank growth, fruit shedding, reduce lint yield, hamper defoliation, encourage insects and diseases, delay maturity, increase adverse environmental impacts, and ultimately decrease the overall productivity of the land.

To ensure optimal cotton production, it's crucial for growers to apply adequate nitrogen fertilizers based on factors such as paddock history, yield expectation, potential losses, soil N supply, and seasonal conditions. While other essential plant nutrients like potassium (K) are also important for cotton growth, nitrogen stands out as a critical factor due to its direct impact on crop development.
