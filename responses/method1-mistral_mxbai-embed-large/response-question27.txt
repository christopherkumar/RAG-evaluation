 The 2018 edition of NUTRIpak includes several differences compared to earlier versions, such as taking into account the higher average yields now being achieved by Australian cotton growers and the corresponding increases in plant nutritional requirements and nutrient exports. This new version reflects significant nutrition research and development since the previous edition was published in 2001. Additionally, NutriLOGIC, a tool used in NUTRIpak for analyzing plant nutrient status, has been updated with new calculations and inputs.
