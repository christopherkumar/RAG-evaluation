 Soil organic carbon (SOC) is measured using various analytical methods such as Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Soil Organic Matter (SOM) analysis. TOC provides a measure of all the carbon present in the soil, both organic and inorganic. On the other hand, SOM is defined as 'all of the organic materials found in soils, irrespective of its origin or state of decomposition.' It is crucial to test for SOC correctly to track changes in SOM and ensure meaningful results. This information is important because soil organic matter (SOM) is a critical component of healthy soils and sustainable agricultural production. It is composed mainly of carbon and various nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. Measuring SOC helps growers understand the current state of their soil's carbon reserves, which can influence crop performance and overall soil health.
