 Soil structure refers to the physical arrangement of individual soil particles into larger units called peds or aggregates. It plays a crucial role in the overall health of the soil by influencing various properties such as water retention, aeration, and root penetration. Well-structured soils have good aggregation and provide optimal conditions for water storage and air movement. This, in turn, promotes healthy soil biota activity and nutrient cycling, contributing to the productivity and sustainability of the soil. Conversely, poorly structured soils can lead to compaction, reduced water infiltration, and impeded root growth, potentially impacting the health and productivity of the soil negatively.
