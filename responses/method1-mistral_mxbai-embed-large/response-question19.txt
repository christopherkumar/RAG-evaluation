 Soil biology can be measured effectively in the field by using various methods and techniques, as described in the context provided. Some of these methods include measuring microbial activity through Fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDA), measuring the total amount of microbes in the soil with Microbial Biomass Carbon (MBC) tests, and assessing the more labile, active carbon fraction using Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) analyses. Additionally, collecting soil samples correctly by avoiding atypical areas and ensuring accurate representation is essential to obtain meaningful results in tracking changes in Soil Organic Matter (SOM).
