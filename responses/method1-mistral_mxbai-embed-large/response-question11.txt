 The Resistance Management Plan (RMP) is a proactive plan designed to mitigate the risks of insect resistance developing in Bt cotton. The principles of the RMP include:

1. Minimizing the exposure of Helicoverpa spp. to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins Cry1Ac, Cry2Ab and Vip3A.
2. Providing a population of susceptible individuals that can mate with any resistant individuals, hence diluting any potential resistance.
3. Removing resistant individuals at the end of the cotton season.

The elements of the RMP are:

1. Planting timing restrictions: This refers to specific planting dates to ensure that susceptible Helicoverpa spp. are present in the field when Bt cotton is being grown.
2. Refuges: These are unsprayed areas of cotton or other crops where susceptible Helicoverpa spp. can survive and breed, providing a source of susceptible individuals for mating with any resistant individuals that may be present in the Bt cotton field.
3. Control of volunteers and ratoon cotton: This involves removing volunteer cotton plants from non-Bt fields and not planting ratoon cotton (replanting the same cotton crop in the same season) to prevent the buildup of resistant Helicoverpa spp. populations.
4. Pupae destruction/trap crops: This involves destroying pupae (the stage between larvae and adult insects) or growing trap crops (attractive non-Bt crops) to divert Helicoverpa spp. away from the Bt cotton fields, reducing their exposure to the Bt proteins.
5. Scouting: Regularly checking the crops for pests, damage, weeds, and growth to ensure that insecticide applications are targeted effectively and that any resistance issues are identified early.
