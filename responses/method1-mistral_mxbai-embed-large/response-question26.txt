 Based on the context provided, the visual soil assessment's approach to evaluating rooting depth, surface ponding, and erosion involves the following:

1. Rooting Depth: The text mentions the importance of examining the nutrient requirements of cotton crops and describing soil testing procedures that can identify nutritional deficiencies or imbalances. This implies that evaluating rooting depth is an essential part of a visual soil assessment. While the text doesn't explicitly state how to assess rooting depth visually, it does suggest collecting soil samples 10-15 cm deep for analysis, which can provide information about root penetration and distribution.

2. Surface Ponding: The context describes the importance of monitoring patches of unexplained unthrifty or stunted plants and sending a sample of soil if concerned. These patches could be caused by surface ponding, which reduces air and water exchange at the root zone and can lead to nutrient deficiencies or anaerobic conditions that harm the cotton crop. Visual assessment of surface ponding involves inspecting the soil texture for signs of standing water or excess moisture and noting any areas where water accumulates after a rain event.

3. Erosion: The text briefly mentions the importance of maintaining soil structure to prevent erosion and improve water infiltration. To evaluate erosion visually, one can look for signs of soil slippage, gullies, or rills, which are indicative of erosion. Additionally, assessing the condition of crop residues on the soil surface, as well as inspecting the distribution and stability of soil aggregates, can provide information about the soil's susceptibility to erosion.
