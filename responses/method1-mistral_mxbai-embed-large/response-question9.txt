 To optimize spray application, several factors need to be considered carefully. These include:

1. Appropriate nozzle selection for products and adjuvants based on label requirements and target conditions.
2. Proper operating parameters such as nozzle spacing, operating pressure, travel speed, and spray release height.
3. Meeting label requirements for spray quality and drift risk.
4. Timing of mobile targets (insects) for optimal effectiveness.
5. Careful calculation of actual field rates for product and water.
6. Ensuring the water used is of suitable quality.
7. Consideration of potential incompatibilities during mixing.
8. Identifying spray drift factors and avoiding hazardous inversion conditions, possibly halting the spray operation if conditions become unfavorable.
9. Familiarity with product labels to understand their recommendations and restrictions.
10. Following up on recommendations by assessing efficacy and efficiency post-spray.
11. Using mult-outlet nozzle bodies for easy nozzle changes.
12. Utilizing water rates appropriate for the coverage required while maintaining product efficacy, considering minimum water rates and weather conditions.
13. Selecting suitable droplet sizes to achieve target coverage without increasing off-target movement risk.
14. Consideration of swath width and its relation to a spray plane's swath width.
15. Membership or accreditation with organizations like the Aerial Application Association of Australia (AAAA) for professional services and resources.
16. Reducing drift by maximizing efficacy against target pests while minimizing off-target movement, considering weather conditions and spray application setup and operation.
17. Using vegetative plantings as spray drift barriers instead of remnant native vegetation or environmental corridors.
