 Based on the context provided, there are several ways of applying nitrogen (N) to a cotton crop. These include:

1. Organic matter: Cotton plants take up most of their nitrogen requirements from the soil, particularly in irrigated crops where nitrate-N is commonly located in the surface soil (0-50 cm). Organic matter in the soil plays an essential role in providing mineralized N and fertilizer N for the crop.
2. Fertilizers: Nitrogen can be applied to the soil as commercial fertilizers, which are used both in irrigated and dryland crops. The choice of fertilizer type depends on factors such as soil conditions, irrigation availability, and crop growth rates.
3. Legume rotation crops: Growing legume crops before cotton is an effective way to improve soil nitrogen levels by fixing atmospheric N through the process of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. The use of commercial legume crops or inoculating legume seed with beneficial bacteria before sowing can enhance this effect.
4. Slow-release N: Applying slow-release N fertilizers, which gradually release N over an extended period, is a practical solution for maintaining consistent soil nitrogen levels throughout the cotton growing season.
5. Soil structural improvement: Improving soil structure and enhancing its water retention capacity can lead to better nitrogen utilization and uptake by the crop. This is particularly important in dryland farming systems where N uptake may extend deeper into the soil profile (120-150 cm).
6. Minimizing losses: Losses of N from the system due to factors such as denitrification, volatilization, and leaching should be minimized through appropriate irrigation practices and soil management strategies. This will ensure that more nitrogen is available to the cotton crop when it needs it most.
7. Efficient use of N: Ensuring the efficient use of applied nitrogen by optimizing fertilizer application rates, irrigation practices, and other crop management strategies is essential for achieving high yields while minimizing environmental impact and cost.
