 Square retention assessment should commence at 3-4 fruiting branches, which is approximately between 9-12 nodes on the cotton plant. The following actions should be taken for pest control up to the first 5 fruiting branches:

1. Less than 40% retention: Take control action if pest insects are still present at threshold and the crop has reached 4-5 fruiting branches. No action is required for retention levels between 40-80%. Monitor for insects in all cases. Some insect damage to reduce retention may be desirable, particularly in warm areas.
2. 40-60% retention: Retention levels are adequate, but ensure that retention is trending upwards if closer to 40%. Continue monitoring for insects.
3. More than 80% retention: No action is required, but monitor for insects. If retention is very high (greater than 80%), some square loss may be desirable.

It's essential to avoid applying insecticides before 4 fruiting branches are produced where possible as it can negatively impact the build-up of natural enemy populations. Actively manage for retention from 4-5 fruiting branches, checking for pest activity prior to spraying and considering the possibility that environmental factors may have caused square loss. Remember that the plant can compensate for sites lost during early squaring.

It's also important to be aware of physiological shedding due to sub-optimal temperatures, cloudiness or moisture stress as this is a natural response that allows continued growth and rapid recovery once conditions improve. However, maintaining a large early season fruit load during periods of short-term environmental stress can limit future canopy expansion, fruiting site production, and even lead to premature cut-out, and be counter-productive for yield potential.
