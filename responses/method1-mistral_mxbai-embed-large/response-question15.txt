 According to the context provided, the main components of soil biology include living organisms such as plants (flora), animals (fauna), bacteria and fungi (microflora), protozoa and nematodes (microfauna), mites and collembola (mesofauna), and earthworms, ants, termites, dung-beetles, and other larger organisms (macrofauna). The non-living organic matter also plays a role in soil biology as it serves as the source of nutrients for these organisms through decomposition.
