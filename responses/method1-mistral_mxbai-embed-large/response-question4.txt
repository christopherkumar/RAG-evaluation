 The major nutrients taken up by cotton, as discussed in the context, include nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulphur (S), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), boron (B), molybdenum (Mo), and oxygen. However, the text focuses particularly on nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, calcium, and magnesium in terms of their quantities taken up by cotton and removed in seed cotton. High-yielding cotton crops remove a significant amount of these nutrients from the soil for production.
