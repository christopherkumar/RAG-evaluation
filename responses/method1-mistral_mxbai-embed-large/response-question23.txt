 Based on the context provided, here are some best practices to manage soil compaction in wet conditions:

1. Reduced tillage and permanent bed systems: These practices can help alleviate soil compaction and the severity of waterlogging.
2. Introduce practices that increase water infiltration rate and internal drainage: Use of gypsum rotation and cereal can help reduce the duration of anaerobic soil conditions.
3. Shorten irrigation duration: Optimally fill the soil profile to prevent prolonged waterlogging.
4. Adjust seasonal N application tactics: Account for limitations not addressed in the points above, such as adjusting N application tactics to avoid excess vegetative growth or pest carryover.
5. Monitor weather and delay irrigation if there is a high chance of significant rainfall at the scheduled irrigation time.
6. Ensure proper irrigation scheduling: Avoid frequent irrigations that increase the risk of waterlogging, and use soil moisture monitoring equipment to optimize irrigation scheduling.
7. Prevent pest carryover: Ensure 100% crop destruction, prevent regrowth through tactics such as crop mulching or slashing followed by effective management practices, and maintain good farm hygiene through complementary crop rotation and conservation of beneficial populations.
