 Nutrient deficiencies in cotton can manifest in various ways, depending on the specific nutrient that is lacking. Nitrogen (N) deficiency, for instance, causes small, pale yellow leaves with fewer nodes and reduced vegetative and fruiting branches. Sulfur (S) deficiency, though rare in irrigated cotton, can lead to stunted growth, fewer flowers or fruiting branches, and boll size reduction. Zinc (Zn) deficiency may not be noticeable at first but eventually leads to interveinal necrotic lesions (bronzing), pale yellow, blotchy chlorosis, and malformed leaves with torn margins. Other nutrients like Fe, Zn, Cu, Mo, B, and Ca can also cause deficiency symptoms that vary in appearance. It's important to assess crop nutrient status regularly using methods such as leaf and petiole analysis, which can identify where deficiencies or imbalances may occur. Soil and plant testing procedures are crucial for understanding the nutrient availability in the soil and the uptake by the plant. If deficiencies are detected, remedial actions like applying appropriate fertilizers can help alleviate the nutritional disorders.
