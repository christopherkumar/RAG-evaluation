 Earthworms are not as important or good an indicator of how healthy the soil system is in Australian cotton systems as was once thought. While they do contribute to soil health by breaking down organic matter and improving soil structure, their presence alone does not necessarily indicate a healthy or productive soil environment for cotton crops. Other factors such as microbes, nutrient availability, water holding capacity, and soil structure are also crucial determinants of the overall health and productivity of soils in Australian cotton systems.
