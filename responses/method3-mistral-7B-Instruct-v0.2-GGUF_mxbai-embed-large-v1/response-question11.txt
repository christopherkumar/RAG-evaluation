 The Resistance Management Plan (RMP) is based on three basic principles: (1) minimising the exposure of Helicoverpa spp. to the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins Cry1Ac, Cry2Ab and Vip3A; (2) providing a population of susceptible individuals that can mate with any resistant individuals, hence diluting any potential resistance; and (3) removing resistant individuals at the end of the cotton season.

The elements of the Resistance Management Plan are:

1. Planting timing restrictions
2. Refuge crops
3. Control of volunteers and ratoon cotton
4. Pupae destruction/trap crops
5. Spray limitations
