 Retaining cotton stubble has several advantages in a dryland cotton crop system.

First, returning cotton stubble to the soil adds organic matter, which improves soil tilth and structure. A study conducted at Narrabri over three years found that removing cotton stubble reduced lint yield and profitability over time compared to the stubble-retained treatment.

Second, retaining cotton stubble helps maintain soil moisture by reducing evaporation and enhancing soil water storage. This is especially important in dryland cotton crop systems where water availability is limited.

Third, incorporating cotton stubble into the surface soil provides a source of energy for the microbial biomass, which in turn helps break down organic matter and releases nutrients that can be taken up by the cotton plants.

Fourth, retaining cotton stubble on the surface also creates greater biological activity in the soil. This is because the decomposing stubble provides a food source for a variety of soil organisms, including bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and earthworms. These organisms play important roles in maintaining soil structure, improving soil fertility, and enhancing plant growth and development.

In summary, retaining cotton stubble in a dryland cotton crop system has several advantages, including adding organic matter to the soil, improving soil tilth and structure, reducing evaporation and enhancing soil water storage, providing a source of energy for the microbial biomass, and creating greater biological activity in the soil. These advantages can help improve soil health, enhance crop productivity, and promote sustainable agriculture in dryland cotton crop systems.
