 There are several ways to apply nitrogen (N) to a cotton crop. These methods include:

1. Pre-plant application: This method involves applying N to the soil before planting. This can be done using various forms of N, such as ammonium sulfate or urea.
2. Side-dress application: This method involves applying N to the side of the cotton plants, usually when the plants are about 6 inches tall. This can be done using various forms of N, such as ammonium nitrate or urea.
3. Top-dressing application: This method involves applying N to the top of the cotton plants, usually when they are in the flowering stage. This can be done using various forms of N, such as calcium nitrate or potassium nitrate.
4. Foliar application: This method involves spraying a solution of N onto the leaves of the cotton plants, usually when they are in the flowering stage. This can be done using various forms of N, such as urea or ammonium sulfate. However, it is important to note that foliar application of N should only be used as a supplemental method of N application, and should not be relied upon as the sole method of N application for a cotton crop.
5. Use of N-fixing bacteria: This method involves inoculating the soil with N-fixing bacteria, such as Rhizobium or Azotobacter, before planting the cotton crop. These bacteria are able to convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which can then be taken up by the cotton plants and used for growth and development. However, it is important to note that this method of N application is not widely used in commercial cotton production due to a number of challenges and limitations associated with the use of N-fixing bacteria in cotton production. Some of these challenges and limitations include:

* The requirement for precise and timely inoculation of the soil with N-fixing bacteria, as well as the need for regular monitoring and maintenance of the bacterial population in the soil.
* The limited ability of N-fixing bacteria to provide sufficient amounts of N to support the growth and development of a commercial cotton crop under typical growing conditions. This is due to a number of factors, including the relatively low efficiency of N-fixing bacteria in converting atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, as well as the limited availability of other essential nutrients and micronutrients that are necessary for the growth and development of a commercial cotton crop.
* The potential for competition between the cotton plants and the N-fixing bacteria for the available supplies of water and nutrients in the soil. This can limit the ability of the N-fixing bacteria to effectively support the growth and development of the cotton plants under typical growing conditions.
* The potential for the use of N-fixing bacteria in cotton production to contribute to the development of other environmental issues and challenges, such as increased levels of greenhouse gas emissions due to the increased demand for energy inputs to support the growth and development of the cotton plants under typical growing conditions. This can limit the ability of the N-fixing bacteria to effectively support the growth and development of the cotton plants under typical growing conditions.

Overall, while the use of N-fixing bacteria in cotton production can offer some potential benefits, such as reduced reliance on synthetic fertilizers and potential for improved soil health, there are also several challenges and limitations associated with their use in commercial cotton production, particularly under typical growing conditions.
