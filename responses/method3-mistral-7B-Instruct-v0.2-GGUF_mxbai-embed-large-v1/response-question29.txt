 To manage nutrient cycling effectively in cotton production, the following strategies can be implemented:

1. Optimizing nitrogen management: The most efficient use of nitrogen fertiliser is achieved by applying the correct rate at a time when N loss will be minimal. This typically means applying nitrogen after June when cooler conditions slow down the nitrification and denitrification processes.

2. Minimizing nutrient losses through leaching and denitrification: Large quantities of fertiliser N can be lost from the production system through either leaching (lateral and horizontal) or biological denitrification before crop uptake. To minimize these losses, proper irrigation management practices and the use of cover crops can help reduce the potential for leaching and denitrification.

3. Enhancing phosphorus availability: Much has been learned about phosphorus management, and new research suggests that cotton roots are not very good at exploiting banded applications of phosphorus. Instead, updated advice recommends treating the largest volume of soil as possible to maximise the fertiliser that can be intercepted by plant roots. To enhance phosphorus availability in the soil, practices such as liming, using organic manures or cover crops, and applying soluble phosphorus fertilisers can help improve overall soil fertility and promote better nutrient cycling for cotton production.
