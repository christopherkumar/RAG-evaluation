 Soil structure is an essential aspect of soil health because it determines how air, water, nutrients, and microorganisms move through the soil. A good soil structure allows for optimal root growth, water retention, and nutrient cycling. On the other hand, poor soil structure can lead to compaction, erosion, nutrient leaching, and reduced root penetration. Therefore, maintaining a good soil structure is crucial for promoting soil health, productivity, and sustainability.
