 According to current research, the main components of soil biology are:

1. Soil Microorganisms: Bacteria, archaea, fungi, protists, and viruses. These organisms play a crucial role in maintaining soil health by contributing to nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and soil structure stabilization.
2. Soil Fauna: Earthworms, ants, termites, dung-beetles, mites, collembola, springtails, and many other invertebrates. These organisms contribute to soil health by feeding on soil microorganisms, decomposing plant litter, and mixing and aerating the soil.
3. Soil Macrofauna: Larger invertebrates such as beetles, centipedes, millipedes, snails, slugs, spiders, and various other arthropods. These organisms play a crucial role in maintaining soil health by contributing to nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and soil structure stabilization through their feeding and decomposition activities and by creating and occupying complex habitat structures that increase the overall biodiversity of the soil ecosystem.
4. Soil Humus: A dark, stable, and complex organic matter formed from the decomposition of plant and animal residues, crop stubble, and old plant roots. Soil humus plays a crucial role in maintaining soil health by contributing to nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and soil structure stabilization through its adsorptive properties that enable it to bind and retain various nutrients and organic matter components, thereby increasing their availability to plants and other organisms in the soil ecosystem. Additionally, soil humus plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall structure and stability of the soil by contributing to the formation and stabilization of aggregates and pore spaces through its adhesive properties that enable it to bind and hold together various soil particles and organic matter components, thereby increasing their resistance to erosion and compaction and enabling them to maintain their structural integrity and functionality over time. Overall, soil humus plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall health, productivity, and sustainability of the soil ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and soil structure stabilization through its various properties and functions.
