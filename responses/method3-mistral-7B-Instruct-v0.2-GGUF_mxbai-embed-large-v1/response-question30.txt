 Long-fallow disorder refers to the negative impact of long periods of bare, weed-free fallow lands or non-mycorrhizal crops, such as canola, on soil health and specifically mycorrhizal populations.

Mycorrhizal fungi (VAM) form symbiotic relationships with the roots of cotton plants. These fungi improve the supply of some essential nutrients to the plant. In turn, the plant provides carbohydrates to the fungi.

However, long-fallow disorder can significantly reduce the mycorrhizal populations in cotton soils. This occurs due to a few reasons:

1. Absence of living roots: During long fallow periods, there is an absence of living roots. Mycorrhizal fungi rely on living roots for their energy source and for nutrient exchange with the plant. Without living roots, the mycorrhizal populations in the soil decline significantly.
2. Build-up of toxic compounds: Long fallow periods can lead to an accumulation of toxic compounds in the soil. These toxic compounds can include heavy metals, salts, and other harmful substances. Mycorrhizal fungi are sensitive to these toxic compounds and can be inhibited or even killed by high concentrations of these substances.
3. Competition with other organisms: During long fallow periods, the soil environment becomes less complex and less diverse. This can lead to an increase in competition among the various organisms present in the soil. Mycorrhizal fungi are not the only organisms that form symbiotic relationships with plant roots. Other types of beneficial microorganisms, such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria, also form symbiotic relationships with plant roots. During long fallow periods, these beneficial microorganisms can become less abundant or even disappear altogether from the soil. This can lead to an increase in competition among the various organisms present in the soil for the available resources. Mycorrhizal fungi are not the only organisms that form symbiotic relationships with plant roots and compete with other organisms for resources in the soil environment during long fallow periods.
4. Lack of nutrient input: During long fallow periods, there is a lack of nutrient input into the soil. Mycorrhizal fungi rely on the availability of certain essential nutrients, such as phosphorus and zinc, in the soil to form symbiotic relationships with plant roots and provide beneficial nutrient uptake services for the plant. However, during long fallow periods, the availability of these essential nutrients in the soil declines significantly due to the lack of nutrient input into the soil. This can lead to a significant decline in mycorrhizal populations in the soil during long fallow periods and a corresponding reduction in the beneficial nutrient uptake services provided by mycorrhizal fungi for the cotton plant.
5. Lack of soil structure: During long fallow periods, there is a lack of vegetative cover and root activity in the soil. This can lead to a decline in soil structure and aggregation during long fallow periods. Mycorrhizal fungi play an important role in maintaining soil structure and aggregation by forming extensive networks of fungal hyphae that bind soil particles together and contribute to the formation of stable soil aggregates. However, during long fallow periods, there is a decline in mycorrhizal populations in the soil due to the lack of nutrient input into the soil and the absence of living roots for mycorrhizal fungi to form symbiotic relationships with. This can lead to a significant decline in soil structure and aggregation during long fallow periods, which can in turn negatively impact the growth and development of cotton plants in subsequent growing seasons.
6. Increased susceptibility to soil-borne diseases: During long fallow periods, there is an absence of living roots and vegetative cover in the soil. This can lead to an increase in the population of soil-borne pathogens and diseases, such as Fusarium wilt, Pythium root rot, Rhizoctonia damping-off, and Verticillium wilt, which can survive and thrive in the absence of living roots and vegetative cover.

Mycorrhizal fungi play a critical role in protecting cotton plants from soil-borne diseases by forming symbiotic relationships with plant roots and providing beneficial nutrient uptake services for the plant. However, during long fallow periods, there is an absence of living roots and vegetative cover in the soil, which can lead to an increase in the population of soil-borne pathogens and diseases. Mycorrhizal fungi are not effective in controlling or suppressing soil-borne pathogens and diseases in the absence of living roots and vegetative cover, as they rely on the presence of living roots and vegetative cover in the soil to form symbiotic relationships with and provide beneficial nutrient uptake services for the plant. Therefore, during long fallow periods, cotton plants are more susceptible to soil-borne diseases due to the absence of living roots and vegetative cover in the soil, which can lead to an increase in the population of soil-borne pathogens and diseases.

7. Decreased water holding capacity: During long fallow periods, there is an absence of living vegetation and crops in the soil, which can lead to a decrease in the overall water holding capacity of the soil. Mycorrhizal fungi play a critical role in enhancing the water holding capacity of soils by forming extensive networks of fungal hyphae that grow out from the root system and penetrate deep into the soil pores, increasing the effective porosity of the soil and thereby improving its overall water holding capacity.

However, during long fallow periods, there is an absence of living roots and vegetation in the soil, which can lead to a decrease in the overall water holding capacity of the soil due to the absence of mycorrhizal fungi and their extensive networks of fungal hyphae that penetrate deep into the soil pores and increase the effective porosity of the soil.

Therefore, during long fallow periods, cotton plants are more susceptible to water stress and drought due to the absence of living roots and vegetation in the soil, which can lead to a decrease in the overall water holding capacity of the soil due to the absence of mycorrhizal fungi and their extensive networks of fungal hyphae that penetrate deep into the soil pores and increase the effective porosity of the soil.

8. Increased susceptibility to erosion: During long fallow periods, there is an absence of living vegetation and crops in the soil, which can lead to an increase in the rate of soil erosion due to the absence of vegetative cover that helps to protect the soil from the impact of raindrops, reduce the amount of surface runoff and sedimentation, and help to maintain the overall structural integrity and stability of the soil.

Mycorrhizal fungi play a critical role in enhancing the structural stability and integrity of soils by forming extensive networks of fungal hyphae that penetrate deep into the soil pores and form stable, interconnected aggregates that help to maintain the overall structural stability and integrity of the soil.

However, during long fallow periods, there is an absence of living roots and vegetation in the soil, which can lead to a decrease in the overall structural stability and integrity of the soil due to the absence of mycorrhizal fungi and their extensive networks of fungal hyphae that penetrate deep into the soil pores and form stable, interconnected aggregates that help to maintain the overall structural stability and integrity of the soil.

Therefore, during long fallow periods, cotton plants are more susceptible to soil erosion due to the absence of living roots and vegetation in the soil, which can lead to a decrease in the overall structural stability and integrity of the soil due to the absence of mycorrhizal fungi and their extensive networks of fungal hyphae that penetrate deep into the soil pores and form stable, interconnected aggregates that help to maintain the overall structural stability and integrity of the soil.
