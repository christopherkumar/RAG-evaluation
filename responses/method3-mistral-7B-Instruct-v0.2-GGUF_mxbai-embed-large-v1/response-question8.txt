 The recommended sampling depth for irrigated cotton is 0 to 30 cm. Sampling deeper than 30 cm in irrigated cotton should also be considered for N following long fallow or after rotational pulse crops, and where subsoil constraints, such as salinity and sodicity, are likely to restrict nutrient and water uptake.

For dryland fields, 0 to 10 cm and 10 to 30 cm are standard depths for most nutrients. Additional samples may be taken to a depth of 60-90 cm.

The best time to soil sample in a cotton field depends on the purpose of the sampling. For fertility management, it is recommended to take soil samples during or just after the harvest, when the nutrient status of the soil can be accurately assessed. However, if the objective is to monitor changes in soil fertility over an extended time period, then soil sampling should be carried out at regular intervals throughout the year, ideally during the growing season when the crop is most actively taking up nutrients from the soil.

In summary, the best time and place to soil sample in a cotton field depends on the specific objectives of the sampling, as well as the prevailing environmental conditions in the field. Proper planning and execution of the soil sampling program can help ensure that accurate and reliable information is obtained about the nutrient status and health of the soil in the cotton field, which can then be used to make informed decisions about fertility management practices and other aspects of crop production in the field.
