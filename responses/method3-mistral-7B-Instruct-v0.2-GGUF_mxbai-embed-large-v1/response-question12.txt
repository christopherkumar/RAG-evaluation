 Square retention assessment should commence at the crop stage where there are 3-4 fruiting branches. At this stage, count all positions of the squares.

Up to the first 5 fruiting branches, no pest control action is required if there are no pest insects present at threshold levels. Monitor for insects and take appropriate actions if pests are detected at threshold levels.
