 Based on the context provided in the text, some of the cotton weeds that have reported glyphosate resistance include windmill grass (Chloris truncata), feathertop Rhodes grass (Chloris virgata), and barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-garli). It is important to note that glyphosate resistance can develop in other weed species as well, so it is essential to implement a comprehensive weed management strategy that includes the use of multiple modes of action and cultural practices.
