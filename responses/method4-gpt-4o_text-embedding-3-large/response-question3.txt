In cotton-growing regions, the primary types of soils include:1. **Cracking Clays (Vertosols):** These are naturally fertile, alkaline soils with high clay content. They are dominant in Australian cotton production and have high levels of inherent fertility and organic matter due to their origination from fertile alluvium and wind-blown dust under low rainfall conditions.2. **Chromosols:** Found in the regions of the Macquarie, Namoi, Gwydir, Lachlan, and Murrumbidgee valleys. Chromosols are supportive of woodland and grassland natural vegetation.3. **Sodosols:** Predominant in many Queensland districts, these soils also support woodland and grassland. Prior to cotton cropping, lands with these soil types were typically used for grazing and dryland cereal cropping.
