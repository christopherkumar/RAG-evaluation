### Principles of the Resistance Management Plan (RMP)The Resistance Management Plan is based on three basic principles:1. **Minimizing Exposure**: Reducing the exposure of pests, specifically Helicoverpa spp., to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins such as Cry1Ac, Cry2Ab, and Vip3A.2. **Maintaining Susceptibility**: Ensuring a population of susceptible individuals that can mate with any resistant individuals, thereby diluting potential resistance.3. **Removing Resistant Individuals**: Eliminating resistant individuals at the end of the cotton season to prevent carryover to subsequent seasons.### Elements of the Resistance Management Plan (RMP)The RMP consists of five key elements:1. **Planting Timing Restrictions**: Regulating planting times to manage pest life cycles and reduce resistance pressure.2. **Refuge Crops**: Mandating the planting of refuge crops that are not exposed to Bt proteins, providing a reservoir for susceptible pests.3. **Control of Volunteers and Ratoon Cotton**: Managing volunteer cotton plants and ratoon regrowth to prevent unsystematic exposure to Bt proteins.4. **Pupae Destruction/Trap Crops**: Implementing agricultural practices like pupae busting and using trap crops to manage pest populations effectively.5. **Spray Limitations**: Setting restrictions on the use of foliar Bt and other chemical sprays to manage resistance build-up.These elements are a part of a proactive plan aimed at mitigating the risks of resistance development. Compliance with the RMP is required under the terms of the Bollgard 3 Technology User Agreement and per regulatory conditions for the product.
