Nutrient deficiencies in cotton manifest through a variety of symptoms depending on the specific nutrient that is lacking:1. **Nitrogen Deficiency**:   - Symptoms: Small, pale yellow leaves, stunted growth, fewer nodes, vegetative and fruiting branches reduced in number and length, older leaves turning yellow (due to remobilization of nitrogen to newer growth), and leaves with severe deficiency showing various shades of autumn colors.2. **Phosphorus Deficiency**:   - Symptoms: Stunted plants with dark green foliage, which later become discolored (reddish or purple on some plant parts), delayed and restricted fruiting.3. **Potassium Deficiency**:   - Symptoms: Potassium is crucial in preventing premature senescence. The symptoms include chlorosis followed by necrosis along the leaf margins starting from the lower, older leaves and progressing upwards. Severe deficiency leads to leaf shedding and reduced boll size.4. **Zinc Deficiency**:   - Symptoms: Lack of vigor, plants appearing unthrifty, shorter plants with thin stems, reduced branching, flowering, and boll setting. In young plants, symptoms appear as dark brown interveinal necrotic lesions on older leaves, followed by chlorosis, and young leaves becoming malformed.5. **Iron Deficiency**:   - Symptoms: Yellowing between the veins of young leaves (interveinal chlorosis), eventually the entire leaf may become white. Iron deficiencies are particularly notable in high pH soils, and symptoms can be exacerbated following waterlogging.6. **Sulphur Deficiency**:   - Symptoms: The whole plant turns pale green with younger leaves developing pale yellow chlorosis, eventually developing necrotic lesions, wavy or cupped leaf margins, unthrifty and spindly appearance, reduced flowers or fruiting branches, and smaller bolls.7. **Calcium Deficiency**:   - Symptoms: Unthrifty and poorly developed plants lacking vigor, stunted growth with thin stems, dark green leaves appearing wilted though soil moisture is adequate. Calcium-deficient plants show reduced branching, fewer flowers and bolls set, and dying apical buds and plants before maturity.8. **Magnesium Deficiency**:   - Symptoms: Stunted plants with thin stems and pale green foliage, reduced branching, significantly reduced flower and boll numbers, older leaves showing pale green to yellow interveinal chlorosis, progressive reddening, and development of necrotic lesions.9. **Boron Deficiency**:   - Symptoms: Bushy and stunted plants with shorter branches and internodes, dark green leaves, reduced flower production and boll set, severely deficient crops may die before flowering. Symptoms first appear in new growth, including leaf cupping and dying apical buds, eventually the whole plant may die.10. **Copper Deficiency**:    - Symptoms: Marginal and not commonly observed in cotton, but can interfere with protein synthesis and cause disruption in pollen formation. Its deficiency could also lead to reduced resistance to fungal attacks and issues in chlorophyll formation.Appropriate fertilization and soil management strategies are crucial to prevent and correct these deficiencies, ensuring optimal growth and yield of cotton plants.
