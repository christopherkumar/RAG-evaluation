The Visual Soil Assessment (VSA) uses practical and observable criteria to evaluate several soil attributes. Hereâ€™s how it assesses rooting depth, surface ponding, and erosion:### Rooting DepthRooting depth assessment involves determining how deeply roots extend into the soil. This can be done in multiple ways:- **Digging Holes**: Physically digging to observe root penetration. The upper assessment limit is usually beyond 80 cm.- **Capacitance Probes**: Using probe data to identify root activity depths.- **Hard Pans**: Identifying the presence of hard pans or compacted layers, which can limit root depth.### Surface PondingThe evaluation of surface ponding involves checking the soil's ability to drain water. This includes:- **Mottles Analysis**: Checking for mottles, which indicate anaerobic conditions and poor drainage.- **Farmer Insights**: Speaking to farmers to understand drainage patterns after irrigation or rainfall.- **Direct Observation**: Noting whether water disappears quickly from the surface.### ErosionErosion assessment is about understanding the soil's vulnerability to being eroded by wind or water:- **Visual Inspection**: Looking for signs of soil movement, such as dust storms or soil accumulation on fence lines.- **Landscape Management**: Considering landscape features like laser-levelled fields, which help manage water flow and reduce erosion risks.- **Existing Symptoms**: Noting any rilling (small channels) or gullying (larger channels) in fields or along irrigation channels.These assessments give insights into soil health, helping identify potential problems and enabling better soil management practices.
