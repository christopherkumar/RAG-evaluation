Long-fallow disorder (LFD) significantly impacts the populations of mycorrhizal fungi in cotton soils, leading to poor mycorrhizal colonization. Mycorrhizae, particularly Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhizae (VAM), are crucial for the uptake of essential nutrients like phosphorus (P) and zinc (Zn), which are less mobile in the soil. When cotton soils experience long fallow periods—characterized by bare, weed-free fields or the growth of non-mycorrhizal crops—the levels of VAM tend to diminish substantially.The reduction in VAM populations has serious implications for cotton production, especially in rain-fed conditions requiring optimal soil moisture. Poor VAM colonization can lead to nutrient uptake problems, particularly for Zn and P. This, in turn, results in Zn deficiencies in the crops, which are often manifested as stunted growth and lower yields. Even when VAM fungi are reintroduced into the soil, nutrient uptake does not reach significant levels required for healthy crop growth.Management of LFD typically involves integrating crop rotations with shorter fallows, ensuring that crops that support mycorrhizal growth are included in the farming system. The incorporation of VAM-compatible crops helps maintain an active population of beneficial fungi in the soil, thereby mitigating the negative impacts of long fallow periods. Additionally, strategies like the use of green-manure or other cover crops can help restore sufficient levels of mycorrhizal fungi, thereby enhancing nutrient uptake and improving overall soil health and crop yields.
