The key insect pests in cotton farming include the following:1. **Aphids** – These insects, including Cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii), Cowpea aphid (Aphis craccivora), and Green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), are common in cotton crops. They can cause stunting, leaf damage, and can transmit cotton bunchy top disease (CBT).  2. **Armyworms (Spodoptera species)** – Pests such as the Fall armyworm, Lesser armyworm, and Cluster caterpillar can cause significant damage to cotton crops by feeding on plant parts including flowers and bolls.  3. **Helicoverpa** – Includes Helicoverpa armigera (cotton bollworm) and H. punctigera (native budworm). These larvae attack all stages of plant growth and can cause extensive damage.   4. **Mealybug** – Solenopsis mealybug infestations can lead to distorted growth, leaf shedding, premature crop senescence, and significant yield losses if not managed properly.5. **Mirids** – These pests can cause fruit shedding and damage due to their feeding on plant tissues.6. **Mites** – Known to cause leaf damage and hinder photosynthesis, resulting in reduced crop yield.7. **Soil and Establishment Pests** – Pests like cutworms and wireworms impact young cotton plants, causing issues from the seedling stage onwards.8. **Stink Bugs and Stainers** – Performing as serious pests, species like the Green vegetable bug, Green stink bug, Brown marmorated stink bug, and Red banded shield bug can damage bolls and seeds.9. **Thrips** – These insects are primarily pests of cotton seedlings but can also be predators of mite eggs later in the season. Common species include Tobacco thrips (Thrips tabaci), Tomato thrips (Frankliniella schultzei), and Western flower thrips (F. occidentalis).10. **Whitefly** – This pest can transmit diseases such as Cotton leaf curl virus and cause significant economic and yield impacts.Remember, managing these pests typically involves integrated pest management (IPM) strategies combining chemical, biological, and cultural controls to keep pest populations at manageable levels.
