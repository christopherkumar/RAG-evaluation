Key cotton diseases include:1. **Alternaria Leaf Spot (ALS)**: Caused by Alternaria alternata and other minor species. It's common in cotton and causes leaf spots at all growth stages, especially in seedlings and late in the season.2. **Black Root Rot (BRR)**: Caused by Berkeleyomyces rouxiae, affecting root cortex and causing stunted growth, particularly in cool, wet conditions.3. **Boll Rot, Tight Lock & Seed Rot**: Caused by various pathogens like Fusarium, Diplodia, and others, leading to rotting of bolls and seeds, often exacerbated by wet conditions and pest injuries.4. **Cotton Bunchy Top (CBT)**: A viral disease causing mottling, stunted growth, and small bolls, transmitted by cotton aphids.5. **Fusarium Wilt**: Caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum, resulting in wilting, browning of stems, and death of plants, particularly under stress conditions.6. **Nematodes**: Parasitic worms that affect the roots of cotton plants, leading to nutrient deficiency and reduced plant vigor.7. **Ramularia Leaf Spot**: Characterized by grey powdery growth on leaves, causing premature defoliation. Favored by humid conditions.8. **Reoccurring Wilt**: Caused by novel Eutypella species, presenting as sudden plant death, discoloration, and vascular issues.9. **Seedling Diseases**: Caused by pathogens like Rhizoctonia solani and Pythium ultimum, leading to damping off and slow growth of seedlings.10. **Verticillium Wilt**: Caused by Verticillium dahliae, it results in dark brown streaks in stems and leaf mottling, favored by cooler temperatures and over-irrigation.11. **Other Diseases**: Including bacterial blight, tobacco streak virus, and tropical rust, which are less common due to breeding programs and biosecurity measures.These diseases are managed through integrated disease management (IDM) tactics including crop rotation, resistant varieties, biosecurity, and balanced crop nutrition.For more detailed guidelines and information, visit sources like CottonInfo and refer to specific chapters in the Cotton Pest Management Guide.
