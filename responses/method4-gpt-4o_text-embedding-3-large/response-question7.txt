The common methods of applying nitrogen (N) to cotton crops include:1. **Pre-plant Application**:   Applying nitrogen before planting helps ensure that there is enough nitrogen available for the young plants as they establish and grow. This can involve incorporating anhydrous ammonia or urea into the soil. Anhydrous ammonia must be placed deeper than 15 cm to minimize loss, while urea can be dissolved in irrigation water or incorporated into the soil through rainfall or irrigation.2. **Side-dressing**:   This involves applying nitrogen fertilizers to the growing crop to meet its increased nitrogen demand as it develops. Side-dressing is usually done before flowering to minimize potential damage caused by the application process. It is important since the highest nitrogen uptake happens between 50 and 110 days after sowing.3. **Foliar Application**:   Foliar applications of nitrogen, such as urea, are often used to rapidly correct nitrogen deficiencies, especially under conditions where root nitrogen uptake is impaired, such as during waterlogging. These applications should be carefully managed to avoid leaf burn and are most effective when applied just prior to waterlogging events.4. **Water-running**:   Dissolving urea in irrigation water and distributing it through the irrigation system is another common practice. This method ensures an even distribution of nitrogen but requires careful management to prevent losses through volatilization and to ensure the nitrogen reaches the root zone.5. **Split Applications**:   Applying nitrogen in several small doses throughout the crop cycle can help reduce losses due to leaching and denitrification, particularly in irrigation-heavy environments. This method also helps manage the risk of having too much nitrogen available at any one time, which can cause excessive vegetative growth and delay maturity.These methods are selected based on factors such as soil conditions, previous crop rotations, weather patterns, and the specific growth stages of the cotton crop to maximize nitrogen use efficiency and minimize environmental impact.
