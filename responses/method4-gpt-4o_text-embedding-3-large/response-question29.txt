Effective nutrient cycling management strategies in cotton production include various practices involving nutrient input, soil health maintenance, and residue management. Here are the key recommended strategies:1. **Nutrient Replacement**:   - **Frequent Assessment**: Regularly assess nutrient status through soil and plant testing to prevent yield limitations due to hidden deficiencies.   - **Replacement Programs**: Adopt a replacement fertiliser program where nutrients removed by the previous crop are replenished to maintain soil fertility.2. **Soil Organic Matter Management**:   - **Increase Organic Matter Inputs**: Increase biomass production through better agronomic practices, and incorporate organic amendments like manure to boost soil organic matter.   - **Minimize Losses**: Reduce losses through erosion and avoid burning crop residues, which can lead to substantial nutrient losses.3. **Stubble Management**:   - **Incorporating Stubble**: Incorporate stubble into soil to enhance nutrient cycling. This can return significant quantities of nutrients to the soil over time.   - **Surface Mulching**: Retaining stubbles on the surface can help reduce evaporation and enhance soil water storage.4. **Efficient Nitrogen Use**:   - **Improve Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE)**: Aim for a high NUE by adjusting seasonal fertiliser application rates and timings. Avoid excessive nitrogen application to reduce environmental impacts and undesired vegetative growth.   - **Utilize Legume Cropping Systems**: Incorporate legume crops in rotations to improve soil nitrogen fertility through biological nitrogen fixation.5. **Phosphorous Management**:   - **Broad Application**: Distribute phosphorus fertilizers across the largest possible soil volume to ensure better root uptake.   - **Soil and Tissue Testing**: Use soil testing methods like Colwell P and tissue testing to monitor and adjust phosphorus levels efficiently.6. **Avoiding Excessive Tillage**:   - **Conservation Tillage**: Implement conservation tillage practices to reduce soil disturbance, maintain soil structure, and protect soil organic matter.By integrating these strategies, cotton growers can enhance the nutrient cycling process, maintain soil health, and achieve sustainable high yields while minimizing environmental impacts.
