Common soil constraints affecting cotton crops in Australia include:1. **High Magnesium Content**: High Mg content can lead to decreased soil structural stability and increased clay dispersion. This is particularly problematic in clay soils, and can suppress the uptake of other essential nutrients like potassium.2. **Sulphur Deficiency**: Sulphur is essential for plant growth, including photosynthesis and protein synthesis. Deficiencies are particularly noted in light sandy soils or under waterlogged conditions and can be confused with nitrogen deficiency.3. **Waterlogging**: Cotton is poorly adapted to waterlogged conditions, which can significantly limit production. Symptoms include yellowing of crops, stunted growth, and reduced fruit growth. This can be mitigated by optimizing field design and irrigation scheduling.4. **Potassium Deficiency**: Potassium is crucial for cotton, but deficiencies can occur even in soils with adequate levels if the soil's potassium availability is low or if the plant's root system is inefficient at uptake. This often requires higher critical levels of exchangeable potassium in soils.5. **Mycorrhizal Colonization and Long Fallow Disorder**: Poor mycorrhizal colonization, often a consequence of long fallow periods, can lead to deficiencies in phosphorous and zinc, which impair early plant growth and reduce yields.6. **Iron Deficiency**: Iron deficiencies, particularly in high pH (alkaline) calcareous soils, are exacerbated by conditions like waterlogging. It leads to chlorosis and poor plant growth.Effective management of these constraints involves measures like appropriate fertilization, improved irrigation practices, maintaining soil structure, and ensuring adequate mycorrhizal colonization through crop rotation and minimizing long fallow periods.
