Earthworms in Australian cotton systems perform several roles that can impact both soil health and crop production. However, their impact may differ from that observed in other agricultural systems globally due to Australia's unique environmental conditions.1. **Soil Structure and Porosity**:   - Earthworms contribute to soil structure by creating channels and pores through their burrowing activities. These structures can improve soil aeration and water infiltration. Despite this potential benefit, Australian cotton soils generally have fewer earthworms compared to European or North American soils, leading to less pronounced effects on soil structure and porosity.2. **Organic Matter Decomposition and Mixing**:   - Some earthworm species consume and decompose organic matter, helping to integrate it into the soil. This process can enhance nutrient availability. However, in Australian cotton systems, earthworms that perform significant soil mixing (bioturbation) are not commonly found. The introduced European earthworms are more prevalent in some southern regions and may occasionally play a role in this process.3. **Impact on Crop Production**:   - The larger anecic earthworms, which create deep burrows and transport surface organic matter down into the soil, can sometimes detract from crop production by drawing water away from the root zone, which can be detrimental especially in water-limited environments like many Australian cotton-growing areas.4. **Alternative Soil Health Agents**:   - Given the relatively low abundance and limited impact of earthworms on Australian cropping soils, alternative organisms like ants and termites might be more effective in promoting soil health through their soil-mixing activities and organic matter incorporation.Overall, while earthworms do contribute beneficially to soil health in Australian cotton systems, their role is not as significant as in other regions with higher organic matter and more favorable conditions for earthworm proliferation. Instead, focusing on other soil biota and practices may offer substantial benefits for maintaining and improving soil structure and fertility in these systems.
