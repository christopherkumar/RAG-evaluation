According to current research, the main components of soil biology are:1. **Living Components**:   - **Microflora**: Includes bacteria and fungi.   - **Microfauna**: Contains protozoa and nematodes.   - **Mesofauna**: Consists of mites and collembola.   - **Macrofauna**: Encompasses earthworms, ants, termites, dung beetles, etc.2. **Non-living Organic Matter**:    - All dead or decaying plant and animal matter, crop stubble, and old plant roots.These components together play crucial roles in nutrient cycling, soil structure, and various biological processes essential for healthy soil function.
