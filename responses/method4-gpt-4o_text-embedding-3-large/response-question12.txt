Square retention assessments should commence at 3-4 fruiting branches (9-12 nodes). The retention percentages and corresponding pest control actions up to the first 5 fruiting branches are as follows:- **Less than 40% retention**: Control action should be taken only if pest insects are present and at threshold levels, and if the crop has reached 4-5 fruiting branches.- **40-80% retention**: No action is required; simply monitor for insects.- **More than 80% retention**: No action is needed; monitoring for insects is still required. Some insect damage to reduce retention may even be desirable, particularly in warm areas.
