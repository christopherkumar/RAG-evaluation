### When to Soil Sample in a Cotton Field**Timing:**- Soil sampling should be performed at the same time each year for consistency.- The optimal time for sampling to assess soil fertility and guide seasonal fertilizer tactics is just before the crop is sown. This is usually between July and September.- For nitrogen (N) assessment, particularly to determine the seasonal N fertilizer requirement, sampling should be done from July to September when significant changes in soil nutrient content before sowing are unlikely.### Where to Soil Sample in a Cotton Field**General Strategy:**- Begin with a comprehensive soil sampling grid of approximately 400 m spacing across the fields, which means one sampling site per approximately 16 hectares (ha).- Use yield maps to determine sampling grids or management zones, adjusting the plan to include high- and low-yielding areas and other zones of interest.**Specific Locations:**- Samples should include zones of different yield potentials within the field, specifically:  - High-yielding zone.  - Average-yielding zone.  - Low-yielding zone.- Avoid collecting samples from areas with previous contamination or disturbance, such as:  - Old fence lines.  - Filled-in irrigation channels.  - Near trees or old stumps.- Ensure to avoid sampling from fertilizer bands used in previous (or current) growing seasons, especially where phosphorus (P), zinc (Zn), or potassium (K) fertilizers have been applied.**Depth of Sampling:**- For irrigated cotton fields, the recommended soil sampling depth for most nutrients is from the top 0 to 30 cm of soil. This depth targets the critical root zone area.- For dryland fields, standard sampling should be done at two depths: 0 to 10 cm and 10 to 30 cm to capture a comprehensive nutrient profile.Following these guidelines ensures that you obtain meaningful and representative soil samples that can help in making informed decisions for crop nutrient management.
