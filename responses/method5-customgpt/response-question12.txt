Commencement of Square Retention Assessment
Square retention assessment should commence when the cotton crop reaches 3-4 fruiting branches (9-12 nodes)​​.

Pest Control Actions Up to the First 5 Fruiting Branches
Less than 40% Retention:

Actively manage retention by controlling pests if they are at the threshold. This helps allow compensatory fruit production.
40-80% Retention:

No immediate action is required. Continue monitoring for insects. Some insect damage reducing retention might be desirable in warm areas.
More than 80% Retention:

No action is needed. Continue to monitor for insects​​.
These guidelines help ensure that early fruit loss does not negatively impact crop maturity, lint yield, and quality, as cotton plants can compensate for early fruit loss if growing conditions are favorable​​.
