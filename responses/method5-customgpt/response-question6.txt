Nutrient deficiency symptoms in cotton vary depending on the nutrient involved. Here are some specific symptoms associated with deficiencies of key nutrients:

Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:

Symptoms: Small, pale yellow leaves; stunted plants; fewer nodes and shorter fruiting branches; older leaves turn yellow, then various shades of autumn colors as tannins are expressed​​.
Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:

Symptoms: Stunted plants with dark green foliage that may later become reddish or purple; delayed flowering, boll set, and maturity; poor fruiting when deficiency is not corrected​​.
Potassium (K) Deficiency:

Symptoms: Yellowish-white mottling on older leaves, then rusty bronze color; necrotic spots between veins; leaf margins and tips shrivel and die; young leaves are affected in severe cases; premature leaf shedding; small, immature bolls​​.
Sulphur (S) Deficiency:

Symptoms: Whole plant turns pale green; youngest leaves develop pale yellow chlorosis including the veins; pale brown necrotic lesions on severe deficiency; margins may become wavy or cupped upwards; leaves may be rigid and brittle​​.
Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:

Symptoms: Plants lack vigour and appear unthrifty; dark brown interveinal necrotic lesions on older true leaves; leaf margins cupped upwards; young leaves develop pale yellow, blotchy chlorosis; leaves become small and malformed​​.
Iron (Fe) Deficiency:

Symptoms: Young leaves become yellow between the veins while veins remain green; severe deficiency may cause entire leaf to turn white; leaves appear limp; significant reduction in plant and root growth in severe cases​​.
Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:

Symptoms: Unthrifty plants lacking vigour; stunted with thin stems and dark green leaves; plants appear wilted; reduced branching; few flowers and bolls set; apical buds turn brown and die in severe cases; poor root development​​.
Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:

Symptoms: Pale green to yellow interveinal chlorosis in older leaves; progressive reddening of leaves and pale brown necrotic lesions in severe cases; stunted growth with thin stems and reduced branching in severe deficiencies​​.
These deficiency symptoms typically reflect the mobility of the nutrient within the plant, with mobile nutrients showing symptoms in older leaves and immobile nutrients in younger growth​​.
