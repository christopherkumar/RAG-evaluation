Optimising spray application in cotton involves several key factors to ensure maximum efficacy and minimize off-target movement:

Appropriate Nozzle Selection:

Choose nozzles that are suited to the product, adjuvants, and target. This includes selecting nozzles that can produce the desired droplet size and spray pattern​​.
Operating Parameters:

Ensure correct nozzle spacing, operating pressure, travel speed, and spray release height. These parameters should match the label requirements for spray quality and drift risk​​.
Weather Conditions:

Monitor and record weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and direction. Avoid spraying during temperature inversions or when wind speeds are below 5 km/h or above 20 km/h​​.
Use weather forecast tools to plan spraying operations during optimal conditions​​.
Water Quality and Mixing:

Ensure that the water used is of suitable quality. Follow the correct mixing order to avoid incompatibilities. Poor water quality or improper mixing can significantly impact spray efficacy​​.
Calibration and Maintenance:

Regularly calibrate spray equipment to ensure accurate application rates. Replace nozzles that are not performing to specifications and ensure all equipment is well-maintained​​.
Spray Drift Management:

Use vegetative barriers to reduce drift. Select the appropriate droplet size to minimize off-target movement. Coarser droplets reduce drift risk but must still be effective against the target pest​​.
Application Technique:

Match the application technique to the target and weather conditions. Consider the most suitable timing for mobile targets such as insects and ensure careful calculation of field rates for both product and water​​.
By considering these factors and following best practices, spray application in cotton can be optimized for better pest control and reduced environmental impact.
