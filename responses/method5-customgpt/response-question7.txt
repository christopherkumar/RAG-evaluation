Common ways of applying nitrogen (N) to a cotton crop include:

Pre-plant Application:

N fertilisers can be applied as close to sowing as practical to reduce N losses and maximise effectiveness. Placement is important, with best responses from urea or anhydrous ammonia placed either more than 30 cm beneath the seed row if applied more than one month before sowing, or shallower and to the side of the crop row if closer to sowing​​.
Side-dressing:

This involves applying N fertiliser after the crop has been planted but before flowering. Side-dressing can produce comparable responses to pre-plant applications, assuming sufficient N in the seed bed to prevent early deficiency. Timing is crucial to minimise root pruning and soil disease infection​​.
Foliar Application:

Used particularly when irrigating poorly drained fields or when the crop is stressed due to waterlogging. Foliar applications of urea can be quickly absorbed by the plant and help overcome deficiencies faster than soil-applied N. However, care must be taken to avoid leaf burn by using appropriate concentrations and conditions​​.
Water-run Urea:

Urea can be dissolved in irrigation water and distributed throughout the soil profile. This method can work efficiently as N is evenly delivered across the field, though some N may be wasted in supply channels and tail drains​​.
Anhydrous Ammonia:

This is a popular option for high N needs, applied deeper than 15 cm to avoid ammonia loss. Side-dressing with anhydrous ammonia can be effective under specific conditions to minimize losses and crop damage​​.
Solid Urea Application:

Urea can be spread on the soil surface and then incorporated with irrigation. It's crucial to avoid applying urea to wet or moist soil to minimize volatilisation losses​​.
These methods ensure that the nitrogen is available to the cotton crop at the right time and place, helping to maximize uptake efficiency and minimize losses due to volatilisation or leaching.
