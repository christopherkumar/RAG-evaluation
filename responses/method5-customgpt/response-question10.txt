The key diseases affecting cotton include:

Alternaria Leaf Spot:

Pathogen: Alternaria alternata and other minor species.
Symptoms: Pinhead spots that develop into necrotic lesions surrounded by a purple halo, seen on cotyledons, leaves, squares, and bolls. Severe infection may result in leaf desiccation​​.
Black Root Rot:

Pathogen: Berkeleyomyces rouxiae (formerly Thielaviopsis basicola).
Symptoms: Blackening of the root cortex, stunted growth, increased susceptibility to other pathogens like Pythium or Rhizoctonia​​.
Boll Rot, Tight Lock, and Seed Rot:

Pathogens: Various fungi and bacteria, including Phytophthora, Sclerotinia, Fusarium, Diplodia, and Anthracnose.
Symptoms: Brown or blackened bolls, with various specific symptoms depending on the pathogen. Tight lock refers to bolls that fail to fluff out​​.
Cotton Bunchy Top:

Pathogen: Viral disease spread by cotton aphids.
Symptoms: Pale green angular patterns on leaves, stunted growth, small leaves, short internodes, small bolls, and hairy, dark brown roots​​.
Fusarium Wilt:

Pathogen: Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum.
Symptoms: Vascular discolouration, yellowing, wilting, and eventually plant death​​.
Verticillium Wilt:

Pathogen: Verticillium dahliae.
Symptoms: Dark brown to black streaks through the stem, yellow mottle between veins and around leaf margins, dead tissue at leaf edges​​.
Ramularia Leaf Spot:

Pathogen: Ramulariopsis (syn. Ramularia) species.
Symptoms: Whitish-grey powdery fungal growth on the underside of leaves, leading to premature defoliation​​.
Seedling Diseases:

Pathogens: Various, including Rhizoctonia and Pythium.
Symptoms: Lesions on seedlings, stunted growth, increased susceptibility to other pathogens​​.
These diseases can be managed through various integrated disease management (IDM) tactics, including crop rotation, balanced crop nutrition, appropriate planting densities, and effective seed treatment fungicides​​.
