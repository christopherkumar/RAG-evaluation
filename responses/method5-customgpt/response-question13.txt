Key Insect Pests in Cotton
Helicoverpa spp. (Cotton Bollworm and Native Budworm)

Helicoverpa armigera (cotton bollworm)
Helicoverpa punctigera (native budworm)
These larvae are major pests in conventional cotton, capable of dramatically reducing yield​​.
Aphids

Cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii)
Cowpea aphid (Aphis craccivora)
Green peach aphid (Myzus persicae)
Aphids feed on the undersides of leaves, causing stunting and downward cupping of leaves. They also transmit cotton bunchy top disease (CBT)​​.
Whitefly

Silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia tabaci, MEAM1)
Greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporiorum)
Whitefly infestations result in honeydew contamination which can cause sooty mould and lint discolouration​​.
Thrips

Tobacco thrips (Thrips tabaci)
Tomato thrips (Frankliniella schultzei)
Western flower thrips (F. occidentalis)
Thrips primarily damage cotton seedlings, causing crinkled leaves and 'silvering' on leaf undersides​​.
Mealybugs

Solenopsis mealybug (Phenacoccus solenopsis)
Infestations lead to distorted growth, crinkled leaves, shedding of leaves and bolls, and honeydew excretion promoting black sooty mould​​.
Armyworms

Cluster caterpillar (Spodoptera litura)
Lesser armyworm (S. exigua)
Fall armyworm (S. frugiperda)
Armyworms are leaf feeders that can occasionally attack fruiting structures, with larvae often mistaken for Helicoverpa​​.
Mirids

Mirids damage by feeding on squares, bolls, and young leaves, causing fruit shedding and distortion of plant parts​​.
Stink Bugs and Stainers

Green vegetable bug (Nezara viridula)
Pale cotton stainer (Dysdercus sidae)
These pests penetrate bolls to feed on seeds, causing boll shedding and lint staining​​.
Lygus Bugs

Tarnished plant bug (Lygus lineolaris)
Western plant bug (L. hesperus)
Feeding causes seed abortion, stem or leaf wilting, and poor seed germination​​.
By understanding and managing these key pests, cotton growers can help protect their crops from significant damage and yield loss.
