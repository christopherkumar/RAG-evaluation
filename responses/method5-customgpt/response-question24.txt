Methods to Measure Soil Organic Carbon
Walkley-Black Method

Description: A wet oxidation method where soil organic carbon is oxidized by potassium dichromate and sulfuric acid.
Process: The remaining unreacted dichromate is titrated with ferrous ammonium sulfate to determine the amount of carbon oxidized.
Pros: Widely used, relatively simple and cost-effective.
Cons: Incomplete oxidation of carbon can lead to underestimation.
Loss on Ignition (LOI)

Description: Soil samples are heated at high temperatures (typically around 550°C) to burn off organic matter.
Process: The weight loss of the soil sample before and after ignition is measured to estimate organic carbon content.
Pros: Simple and quick.
Cons: May overestimate organic carbon if other volatile substances are present.
Dry Combustion (LECO)

Description: Soil samples are combusted at high temperatures (up to 950°C) in an oxygen-rich environment.
Process: The carbon dioxide released is measured using an infrared gas analyzer.
Pros: Highly accurate and complete oxidation of organic carbon.
Cons: Requires expensive equipment and is not as cost-effective for routine analysis.
Importance of Soil Organic Carbon
Nutrient Cycling

Role: Soil organic carbon (SOC) is crucial for the cycling of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. It helps in the formation of humus, which stores and releases nutrients to plants.
Benefit: Enhances soil fertility and promotes healthy plant growth.
Soil Structure

Role: SOC acts as a binding agent that helps to aggregate soil particles into stable structures.
Benefit: Improves soil aeration, water infiltration, and retention, reducing erosion and compaction.
Water Retention

Role: Organic matter has a high water-holding capacity, which helps in maintaining soil moisture levels.
Benefit: Provides a more consistent water supply to plants, especially during dry periods.
Microbial Activity

Role: SOC is a food source for soil microorganisms, which play a critical role in decomposing organic matter and cycling nutrients.
Benefit: Supports a healthy and diverse soil microbial community, which is essential for soil health.
Carbon Sequestration

Role: SOC sequesters carbon from the atmosphere, helping to mitigate climate change.
Benefit: Reduces greenhouse gas levels and contributes to global carbon management strategies.
Soil Health Indicator

Role: SOC is often used as an indicator of soil health because it reflects the soil’s ability to support plant and microbial life.
Benefit: Monitoring SOC helps in making informed management decisions to maintain or improve soil health.
Mitigation of Climate Change

Role: Soils with higher organic carbon can store more carbon dioxide, reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.
Benefit: Contributes to efforts in combating climate change by acting as a carbon sink.
Summary
Measuring soil organic carbon is essential for understanding and managing soil health, fertility, and its role in the global carbon cycle. Methods like the Walkley-Black method, loss on ignition, and dry combustion are commonly used to measure SOC, each with its advantages and limitations. Maintaining and enhancing SOC is vital for sustainable agriculture, environmental health, and climate change mitigation​​​​.
