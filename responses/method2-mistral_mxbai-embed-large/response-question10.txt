 Cotton is susceptible to various diseases that can negatively impact crop yield, fiber quality, or even lead to plant death. Here are some common diseases that affect cotton:

1. Bacterial Blight (Xanthomonas axonopodis): This disease is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas axonopodis and usually appears as irregular water-soaked lesions on leaves and stems, which can lead to plant death if left untreated.

2. Fusarium Wilt: Fusarium wilt is caused by several Fusarium species and shows up as leaf discoloration (yellow or brown) and wilting of the plant. This disease attacks the cotton root system and hinders water absorption, ultimately leading to crop failure.

3. Verticillium Wilt: Similar to Fusarium wilt, Verticillium wilt is caused by various Verticillium species and is characterized by leaf discoloration (usually brown), wilting of the plant, and reduced yield due to impaired water absorption.

4. Powdery Mildew: Powdery mildew is a common fungal disease that manifests as white, powdery growth on leaves and stems, which can reduce crop yields if left unchecked. This disease thrives in high humidity conditions and can spread quickly through the cotton crop.

5. Southern Blight: Southern blight is caused by the bacterium Sclerotium rolfsii (Southern Root Rot) or the fungus Sclerotium oryzae (Charcoal Rot). This disease usually starts as a lesion on the base of the cotton plant stem, which can then spread upwards, leading to wilting and death.

6. Gray Mold (Botrytis Cinerea): Gray mold is a fungal disease that appears as grayish-brown, fuzzy growth on leaves, stems, and bolls. This disease favors cool, damp conditions and can spread quickly through the cotton field, reducing yields or even destroying entire crops.

7. Angular Leaf Spot: Angular leaf spot is caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. malvacearum and appears as small, angular brown spots on leaves. If left unchecked, this disease can lead to premature defoliation, reduced fiber quality, and lower yields.

8. Cotton Leaf Curl Virus (CLCV): This virus is spread by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci and appears as curled leaves and stunted growth. Infected plants will usually have reduced yields and poor fiber quality.

9. Early Leaf Curl (ELC): Early leaf curl is a complex disease caused by various strains of the geminivirus and transmitted by mealybugs or whiteflies. It appears as curled leaves, stunted growth, and chlorotic patches on leaves.

10. Target Spot: Target spot is caused by several fungal species, such as Cercospora personata and Phaeosphaeria gossypina, and shows up as small, dark lesions on leaves that can enlarge and merge to create larger spots. This disease typically appears during periods of prolonged leaf wetness.
