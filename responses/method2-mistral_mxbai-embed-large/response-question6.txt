 Nutrient deficiencies can manifest in various ways in cotton, leading to noticeable changes in plant growth and development. Identifying these symptoms early on is crucial for implementing corrective actions and improving crop yields:

1. Yellowing leaves: Nitrogen (N) deficiency can cause older leaves to turn yellow between the veins, eventually spreading to the entire leaf if left untreated. Phosphorus (P) deficiency often appears as a uniform yellowing of younger leaves, while sulfur (S) deficiency presents as a brighter yellow or white coloration along leaf margins.

2. Delayed maturity: Deficiencies in essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium can cause cotton to mature more slowly than usual. This delay can impact harvest timing and overall yields.

3. Poor growth: Nutrient deficiencies can lead to stunted plant growth, reducing the number of bolls per acre and lowering fiber quality.

4. Reduced productivity: Inadequate nutrient availability can significantly decrease cotton productivity, leading to reduced fiber yield and increased economic losses.

5. Premature death: Severe cases of nutrient deficiencies can ultimately lead to premature cotton plant death. This is especially concerning in areas where soil fertility may be limited or challenging environmental conditions exist.

6. Foliar symptoms: Some nutrient deficiencies, such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and boron (B), present with specific foliar symptoms like leaf chlorosis, necrosis, or interveinal chlorosis. These symptoms can help growers identify the underlying cause of the plant issue and take appropriate corrective measures.

7. Compromised seed development: Nutrient deficiencies can negatively impact seed size, shape, and quality. This is especially significant in cotton since fiber yield is a critical determinant of overall profitability and market competitiveness.
