 The 2018 edition of NUTRIpak, which is published by Crop & Pasture Science and produced by the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Primary Industries in Australia, includes several updates and improvements compared to earlier versions. Here are some key differences:

1. Updated nutrient requirements: The 2018 edition features the latest nutrient requirements for various crops grown in NSW based on recent research and farming practices. It provides detailed information on recommended nutrient ranges, application rates, and timings, as well as the sources of essential elements required by each crop.
2. Integrated nutrient management: The 2018 edition includes a more comprehensive approach to nutrient management that covers various methods such as organic, inorganic, and integrated nutrient systems. This integration allows farmers to choose the most suitable options based on their specific farming conditions, budgets, and goals.
3. Enhanced user interface: The 2018 edition offers an improved layout and design compared to earlier versions, making it easier for users to navigate and find the relevant information quickly and effectively. The tables and charts are more clearly presented, with enhanced color schemes that make it simpler to compare different nutrient requirements across various crops.
4. Expanded coverage: The 2018 edition includes detailed nutrient recommendations for a wider range of crops grown in NSW and other regions. This expansion caters to the diverse agricultural landscape of Australia and helps farmers manage their crop nutrition more effectively for various commodities.
5. Integration with AgSolver: The 2018 edition is designed to integrate with the popular agricultural software tool, AgSolver. Users can input nutrient recommendations from NUTRIpak into their AgSolver models, streamlining the process of managing and optimizing crop nutrition using a more comprehensive, data-driven approach.
6. Incorporation of climate data: The 2018 edition includes more detailed information on climate data for various regions across NSW. This integration helps farmers understand the effects of climate variability on nutrient requirements, allowing them to make more informed decisions about crop selection and nutrition management strategies.
7. Sustainability considerations: The 2018 edition places a greater emphasis on sustainable agriculture practices and environmental stewardship. It includes information on minimizing nutrient losses through techniques like nutrient management plans, reducing tillage, using cover crops, and implementing integrated nutrient systems.

By incorporating these updates and improvements into the 2018 edition of NUTRIpak, farmers in New South Wales and other regions can make informed decisions about their crop nutrition based on the latest research and farming practices while considering long-term sustainability goals.
