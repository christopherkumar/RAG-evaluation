 Long-fallow disorder is a condition that occurs when agricultural land lies fallow (unplanted or uncultivated) for extended periods, typically over one year or more. The implications of long-fallow disorder on mycorrhizal populations in cotton soils can be both positive and negative:

1. Positive impact: Long-fallows can promote the growth of various plant species, many of which are mycorrhizal hosts, in the absence of intense crop cultivation or tillage activities. The increased presence and diversity of these host plants result in a higher abundance and activity of mycorrhizal fungi in the soil. These beneficial fungi can form symbiotic relationships with cotton roots during subsequent crops, improving nutrient acquisition, water uptake, and overall plant health.
2. Negative impact: However, long-fallow periods can also lead to reduced mycorrhizal populations if the fallow period includes extensive tillage or herbicides application. Tillage destroys the mycorrhizal mycelium (the fungal network that forms the symbiotic relationship), while herbicides target the host plants that support the mycorrhizal population. This can result in a significant decline in mycorrhizal populations, affecting the cotton crop's ability to efficiently acquire nutrients and water from the soil during the growing season.
3. Changes in soil structure: Long-fallow periods can lead to alterations in soil structure, including increased aggregation and improved air and water movement properties. These structural improvements enhance the survival and growth of mycorrhizal fungi by providing favorable conditions for root penetration and nutrient cycling.
4. Fungal community shifts: Long-fallow periods can lead to changes in fungal communities due to host plant availability, soil conditions, and other factors. For example, certain mycorrhizal species might thrive during long-fallows due to favorable environmental conditions or the absence of competition from crop plants. However, this shift in fungal community structure may not always benefit cotton production, as some mycorrhizal species may be less effective in supporting cotton growth or may require specific host plants for their optimal functioning.
5. Effects on nutrient cycling: Mycorrhizal populations play a significant role in the cycling of essential nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, in the soil. During long-fallow periods, the changes in mycorrhizal populations and fungal community structure can impact nutrient availability for subsequent cotton crops. Depending on the specific conditions during the fallow period, these impacts could range from improved nutrient availability due to increased mycorrhizal activity and host plant growth to decreased nutrient availability if the mycorrhizal population declines significantly.

To mitigate the negative effects of long-fallow disorder on mycorrhizal populations in cotton soils, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach. This includes implementing sustainable agricultural practices that minimize soil disturbance during fallow periods and reducing or eliminating herbicide applications where possible. By doing so, you can support the growth and activity of mycorrhizal populations while promoting overall soil health and productivity for cotton production.
