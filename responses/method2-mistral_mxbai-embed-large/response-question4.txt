 Cotton, like any other crop, requires various essential nutrients for optimal growth and development. Here's a list of the major macronutrients and micronutrients that cotton takes up from the soil:

1. Nitrogen (N): This nutrient is vital for plant growth, playing an important role in protein synthesis within plants. Cotton requires substantial amounts of nitrogen during its vegetative stage, with optimal levels ranging from 200 to 350 pounds per acre.

2. Phosphorus (P): Phosphorus contributes to energy transfer within the plant and plays an essential role in root development, flower initiation, and seed formation. Optimal phosphorus levels for cotton are between 50 to 100 pounds per acre.

3. Potassium (K): This nutrient is crucial for building stems, enhancing photosynthesis, and improving resistance to diseases and drought. Recommended potassium levels for cotton vary based on soil type and are generally around 200 to 300 pounds per acre.

4. Calcium (Ca): Calcium is vital for the growth of cell walls in stems, fruit development, and root growth. Optimal calcium levels for cotton range from 1,000 to 3,000 parts per million (ppm) depending on the soil pH.

5. Magnesium (Mg): This nutrient plays an essential role in chlorophyll production, photosynthesis, and energy transfer within the plant. Optimal magnesium levels for cotton are between 100 to 200 parts per million (ppm).

6. Sulphur (S): Sulfur is an essential component of amino acids, proteins, vitamins, and enzymes in plants. Optimal sulfur levels for cotton are around 30 pounds per acre.

7. Micronutrients: Cotton also requires trace amounts of micronutrients such as boron, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc. These elements contribute to various plant functions including nutrient absorption, photosynthesis, growth regulation, and stress tolerance.

Maintaining optimal levels of these essential macronutrients and micronutrients is vital for achieving high cotton yields while minimizing the need for fertilizer inputs. Regular soil testing is important to ensure proper nutrient management practices are being employed on your farm.
