 Square retention assessment in cotton production is essential for evaluating plant health, identifying potential issues, and implementing effective pest control strategies to optimize yields. The ideal time to begin assessing square retention is typically around the fourth to sixth leaf stage, which is approximately 25-30 days after planting.

At this stage, focus on promoting healthy growth conditions for your cotton plants by addressing the following factors:

1. Nutrient management: Ensure proper fertilization and nutrient availability for the developing squares, as a deficiency in essential minerals or macronutrients can negatively impact square retention.
2. Water management: Maintain consistent water supplies to prevent wilting and ensure the optimal growth of young squares.
3. Weed control: Eliminate weeds competing with cotton plants for resources, as they can inhibit square development and retention.

For pest control, focus on the following actions up to the first 5 fruiting branches:

1. Scouting: Regularly scout fields for early signs of pests or diseases that could negatively impact square retention, such as aphids, thrips, spider mites, and whiteflies.
2. Cultural practices: Implement cultural practices, such as row cover use and crop rotation, to create an unfavorable environment for certain pests while promoting overall plant health and reducing selection pressure on specific pesticides.
3. Biological controls: Consider the use of natural enemies, such as beneficial insects or microbes, to suppress pest populations without relying on chemical inputs.
4. Chemical applications: If necessary, apply appropriate pesticides with caution at this stage, using targeted application methods (e.g., spot treatments) and focusing on integrated pest management approaches to minimize selection pressure on specific chemicals and promote sustainable farming practices.
5. Timing: Apply pesticides at the appropriate time in relation to the development of the cotton plant and the life cycle of target pests, ensuring that the active ingredient reaches its intended target while minimizing exposure to non-target organisms.

Remember, the primary objective is to maintain a healthy crop with an optimal number of squares up to the first 5 fruiting branches to promote strong fiber development and high yields. Regular assessment and timely intervention are crucial components in ensuring square retention and effective pest control during the early growth stages of cotton production.
