 According to numerous studies and reports, the following cotton weed species have been identified as glyphosate-resistant:

1. Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri)
2. Waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus)
3. Redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus)
4. Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisifolia)
5. Horseweed or Marestail (Conyza canadensis)
6. Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum)
7. Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense)
8. Kochia (Kochia scoparia)
9. Pigweed (Chenopodium album)
10. Morningglory (Ipomoea spp.)

It's important to note that glyphosate resistance can vary between populations within the same species and even in the same field. Regularly rotating herbicides and adopting integrated weed management practices, including cultural methods and manual labor, are essential for effective weed control.

Additionally, researchers continue to discover new mechanisms of resistance that may impact the effectiveness of glyphosate against various weed species. Monitoring resistance trends in local weeds is crucial for developing long-term strategies to combat weed populations effectively.
