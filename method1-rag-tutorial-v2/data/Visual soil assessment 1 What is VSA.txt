Hi there. What we’re going to talk about briefly now is the visual soil assessment. It’s a method of conducting a soil health measurement and it’s the one that’s been put forward by the FAO, so it’s been internationally endorsed. Why? Well if we start to measure the status of our soil we can track how that changes over time to let us know if we’re going backwards or forwards. To undertake the test, you’ll need about 20 minutes for each sampling point, and you’ll have to do about 3 samples in every field to get a decent measure. The good news though is all you’ll need to do it is a copy of the FAO’s Visual Soil Assessment (which is available on their website); you’ll need to print off a copy of the scorecard that’s found at the back of that manual; you’ll need a spade (not a shovel) because you’ll have to dig a small hole. You’ll need a box to drop the soil you’ve dug up into, and we suggest you put a piece of wood in the bottom of the box so the bottom doesn’t break. And the final thing you’re going to need is a small tarpaulin, and this is where, working in cotton, most of us have access to a beat sheet, which is brilliant for doing a visual soil assessment. So if you’re interested in looking at the health of your soil, and want to carry out a visual soil assessment, watch the following videos and they’ll take you all the way through the process.
